      <h3>Fact #1</h3>
      <p>
        The average billionaire emits 8,194 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

      <h3>Fact #2</h3>
      <p>
        Since the 1990s, the richest 1% have emitted more than double the carbon of the poorest half of the population.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container-three">
      <img src="./resources/globe.png" width="20%" height="20%">
      <h3>Fact #3</h3>
      <p>
        The carbon emissions of the richest 1% in 2019 were enough to change global temperatures and lead to an estimated 1.3 million deaths. Emissions of the richest 1% will cause 1.3 million heat-related deaths between 2020 and 2030—roughly the equivalent of the entire population of Dallas.

      <h3>Fact #4</h3>
      <p>
        In 2019, the super-rich 1% were responsible for more carbon emissions than 66% of humanity (5 billion people).
      </p>

      <h3>Fact #5</h3>
      <p>
        Corporations are a major contributor to climate change, with 100 companies responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988.
      </p>

      <img src="./resources/globe.png" width="20%" height="20%">
      <h3>Fact #6</h3>
      <p>
        If fossil fuels continue to be extracted at the same rate as they were between 1988 and 2017, global temperatures could rise by 4°C by the end of the century.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="container-seven">
      <img src="./resources/globe.png" width="20%" height="20%">
      <h3>Fact #7</h3>
      <p>
        Meat production is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes methane from cows and sheep, nitrous oxide from animal waste, and carbon dioxide released when forests are cut down to create grasslands for livestock.
